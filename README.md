# NC-IRC-Relay
Relay script for pings from NCdot IRC.
Start the script with a node server or use something like forever https://github.com/foreverjs/forever.
You have to enter the irc user & password and the webhook urls from discord at the top of the `relay.js`.

To install the required package run `npm i`

Afterwards run it with `node relay.js` or `npm start` or `forever start relay.js`.

Forever is the recommand way for longliving use.

If any questions occur, please feel free to hit me up on discord: `Shegox Gabriel#7050` or ingame
